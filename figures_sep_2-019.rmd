# Charlotta's paper
## Figures for Paper



## Summary

 - differences between fetal and adult cells in general

### Volcanoplot 
 - HSC like cells, IL7R prog and proB from adult BM vs w12-13, w8-10 and CS samples 
 - exclude CS16 for now

### GO 
- combine all changed genes between fetal and adult

### UMAP/tSNE plot or PCA plot

- only IL7R and proB from BM and all fetal stages 
- exclude CB, do with and without CS16
